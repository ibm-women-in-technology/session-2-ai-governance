# Step 3 — Incident Management

> [!NOTE]
> **Beyond today's session — see what you can do next.**
> Incident Management closes the loop on the AI governance lifecycle: investigating and
> resolving a live production issue. It goes beyond what we have time for today, but
> everything below is self-contained if you'd like to work through it on your own afterwards.

## Your Assignment

> **Your assigned Use Case:** ___________________________________________
>
> *(Your Use Case name was shared with you before the session started)*

Your Issue has been pre-created on this Use Case and is waiting in your **My Tasks** inbox.
**Go straight to Step 1 below to begin.**

> **Issue not in your inbox?**

> If you do not see an Issue in My Tasks, create one manually:

>    - **Issue Owner:** yourself (your login account)
>    - **Parent Entity:** your assigned Use Case

## What is Incident Management?

Incident Management in IBM OpenPages allows **Risk & Compliance Officers** to track, assess,
mitigate, and communicate risks when something goes wrong with a live AI system. It provides
a structured workflow for logging issues, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring timely
resolution — creating a full audit trail at every step.

### Your scenario

Your AskHR AI system is live and being used by real employees to answer HR policy questions.
The **Answer Relevance** metric has dropped below its configured threshold.

> **What is Answer Relevance?** Answer Relevance measures whether the AI's response actually
> addresses what the user asked. A score below the threshold means employees are receiving
> answers that are off-topic or unhelpful — for example, asking about parental leave policy
> and getting a response about a different policy entirely. This is exactly the kind of
> quality failure that governance frameworks like the EU AI Act require organisations to
> detect, log, and remediate with a documented audit trail.

Your job is to investigate, document a remediation plan, get it approved, and close the
incident — leaving a complete record of what happened and what was done about it.

## Step 1 — Navigate to Your Assigned Issue

- Click on the **My Tasks** tab in IBM OpenPages.

<img width="800" alt="Click on the My Tasks tab when logged in to IBM OpenPages as Use Case Owner." src="./assets/Issue3.png">

- Locate and select the Issue assigned to your Use Case.

---

## Step 2 — Assess Risk and Add Mitigation Actions

- Review the Issue details — determine the **Issue Type**, **Issue Status**,
  **Who Identified the Issue**, and **Priority**

> You can view the related metric in the **Issue Context** section at the bottom of the
> Issue card — this shows the Answer Relevance breach that triggered the incident.

<img width="800" alt="Issue Context section showing the metric in breach." src="./assets/Issue6.png">

- Create an Action Item to remediate the identified deficiency — click **New Action Item**

> **Why create an Action Item?** Closing an issue directly would leave no documented record of what was actually done to fix it. An Action Item is the formal remediation record — it captures who did what and when, and creates the audit trail that regulators require. Without it, you cannot prove the issue was properly addressed.

<img width="800" alt="Create Action Items to remediate the identified deficiency by clicking on New Action Item" src="./assets/Issue8.png">

- Fill out all key details and click **Save**

<img width="800" alt="Fill out all key details and click on Save" src="./assets/Issue9.png">

- The Action Item has been created.

<img width="800" alt="Action has been created." src="./assets/Issue13.png">

- Document the remediation steps you plan to take, then click **Actions → Submit for Approval**

<img width="800" alt="Document the remediation steps undertaken, then click on Action > Submit for approval" src="./assets/Issue5.png">

- Click **Actions → Approve** to approve the action item.

<img width="800" alt="Click on Action > Approve to approve the action item." src="./assets/Issue7.png">

---

## Step 3 — Submit for Review

> **Why submit for review before closing?** This gate enforces segregation of duties — the same person who documented the remediation should not be the one who signs it off as complete. A second reviewer confirms the fix is adequate before the issue is formally closed. This creates an independent verification record in the audit trail, which is what compliance frameworks require.

- Navigate to the **Issue** record
- Click **Actions → Submit for Review**

<img width="800" alt="On the Actions tab, Click on Submit for Review" src="./assets/Issue10.png">

---

## Step 4 — Close the Incident

- On the **Issue** record, click **Actions → Approve** → click **Continue**
- Click **Actions → Close** → click **Continue**

<img width="800" alt="Click on Actions > Close, then click Continue" src="./assets/Issue11.png">

The Issue is now marked as **Closed**.

<img width="800" alt="The issue is now marked as Closed" src="./assets/Issue12.png">

## Well Done!

You have completed the full AI governance lifecycle — from creating a Use Case and assessing
its risks, through development, validation, and deployment, to detecting and resolving a
production incident. This is exactly how AI risk and compliance works in a real organisation
using watsonx.governance.

> Always document each remediation step for audit purposes. Every action in OpenPages is
> logged, timestamped, and traceable — this is what makes AI governance auditable.

## Appendix — Other Ways to Generate Metrics

> The options below are alternative methods for generating a failing metric value in
> OpenPages. They require **OpenScale** access, which is not available in this lab session.
> Provided here as a reference for after the session.

- [Running evaluations via Model Management (OpenScale)](./appendix/model-management-evals.md)
- [Pushing metrics from an external evaluation application](./appendix/integrating-external-evals.md)
